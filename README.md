##US Solar Energy Resources

The purpose of this project is to display the square area of solar panels that would be required to meet the electrical demand of as user selectable US state. Clearly, it hasn't gotten there quite yet.  What it does do is display the solar resource at the geographic center of the lower 48 states and Hawaii.  

This app incorporates the following technologies:
* Single-page React framework
* Redux single source of truth state management
* API calls to various open data sources
* Front-end data visualization with D3
* Low-level SVG animation to enable React to handle DOM manipulation normally handled by D3 and to allow for a fixed y-axis scale to help clearly communicate the relative differences in the various state solar energy resources.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
